## Local Setup

* Open a terminal or command prompt window and clone repo
* git clone https://github.com/amusto/react-shuffle-deck.git
* cd into directory cd ./react-shuffle-deck
* Run `yarn` (Install all libs)

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
